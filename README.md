## **Model Overview**
Five machine learning models were used to predict the outcomes of mental health:  
- Logistic Regression  
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)  
- Random Forest  
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)  
- Decision Tree  

## **Model Performance**
Among these, the **cross-validation accuracy of the KNN model** is the highest, reaching **86.36%**, demonstrating its capacity to generalize well across datasets. The **Random Forest model** shows the highest **accuracy in evaluation**, achieving **75.65%**, which highlights its strength in prediction.
 

## **Conclusion**
The results pave the way for the generation of more advanced, technology-driven tools for the early identification and assessment of mental health issues. This offers a promising route for mental health diagnostics and care.
